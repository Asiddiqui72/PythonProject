# EEG Data Analysis and Classification

Overview
--------

Welcome to my EEG Data Analysis and Classification project. This repository is my personal exploration of EEG data, where I analyze and classify brainwave patterns.

Technologies Used
----------------

- Python for data analysis and machine learning.
- Jupyter notebooks for interactive data exploration.
- Libraries like NumPy, SciPy, and scikit-learn for data manipulation and classification.
- EEG data for understanding brainwave patterns.

Getting Started
---------------

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Explore the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks` directory for insights and examples.
4. Feel free to modify the code to suit your own EEG data experiments.
